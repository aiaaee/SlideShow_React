# Making a slideshow using React hooks and without using CSS
Creating a slideshow using React and creating a dropdown menu without using CSS  Ability to connect to the server

in this project we want to write dropdown menu of slideshow with React hooks as useRef and UseEffect 


first of all , we Create our component and after that create a simple Slideshow.
when we set a Usestate for clicking on menu icon , we can set a slideshow height with css but if we want to write an optimize codes with react , it's better to pay attention to reacts hook , 
react hooks make component development easier while also improving readability and organization
In this project, I will teach you step by step how to use React hooks to create an optimized and widely used slideshow.

1. import UseEffect and useRef from react package

```
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'
```

2. set a two variable for compatibility with JSX elements: 

```
const linksContainerRef = useRef(null)
const linksRef = useRef(null)
```

3. The useEffect hook is used to manage side effects in React. The useEffect hook in React takes 2 arguments from us. The first argument is a callback function in which we must write our side effect. The second argument is our Dependencies, which we must give to useEffect in the form of an array.

```
useEffect(() => {
        const linkHeight = linksRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().height;
        if(showLink){
            linksContainerRef.current.style.height = `${linkHeight}px`
        }
        else {
            linksContainerRef.current.style.height = `0px`
        }
    } , [showLink])
```
4. Finally, we write our variables in JSX elementsâ€Œ.

```
<div className='nav-links' ref={linksContainerRef}>
                <ul className='list' ref={linksRef}>
                </ul>
</div>
```

The source codes are all available in files. 
I hope it was useful for you.
